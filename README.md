# CISC374-BirdTutorial
This is a tutorial project used to overview Unity3D in CISC374.

This is Flappy Robin! A defintelty not a rip of the iconic Flappy Bird game of the 2010s. This game is simple but cutesy. Players can use the spacebar to move the bird between the pipes, and if the player were to get out of bounds or hit the pipe, it is game over. To build upon the original tutorial I did the following:
- Fix Score Bugs
- Fix "Game Over" Issues
- Added Sound Effects and Game Background Music
- Added a High Score Functionality & Display
- Added Cloud Particle Effects in the Background
- Allow the Bird Character to tilt forward and backwards depending on the 'flapping' controls
- Added some Juicy Shaking when the Bird Collides into a Pipe
